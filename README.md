# News Site
A project at the Self-paced Web Bootcamp at Technigo, HTML and CSS module. 


# Description
The assignment was to build a news site focusing on using responsive design and layout techniques. CSS Grid and Flexbox should be used for layout and the design should look good on device from 320px width up to 1600px.

# Approach
- Since I knew I would have a hard time deciding on the topic for my news site I let my daughter choose the topic - a news site about baking.
- After making a draft of the site on paper I started building the overall layout in Codepen. Building a grid with boxes that scaled well on different devices, 1 column on mobile, two on tablet and 4 on desktop.
- I used Chat-GPT to come up with headlines for my news site and Codepen to find images that matched the headlines.
- I then copied the code to Visual Studio and started to refine he layout.
- Now when I had my basic structure I realized that I needed to focus on one device at a time. So I went with the mobile first approach and revised the code to make all element look good on mobile, not caring about the other devices.
- I then when on to adjust the design for tablet and then desktop.

# Future Improvements
- If you had more time, what would be next?
